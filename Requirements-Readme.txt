Hey! blake_young@college.harvard.edu here. Let me know if you want to colab on any cool projects. I'm always down for fun projects. Before running the program, make sure to pip install selenium and pip install webdriver. For this to work you must put in your D and C codes as well as username and password into the covid_testing_automated.py file. It's simple. Just put them in as strings and strings that are passed into the log_onto_color() function and you're good! Goodluck!
